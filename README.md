# Overlapping Communities Assorativity Measure

Repository for an implementation of Shizuka et al. (2016) community assortativity ($R_{comm}$) measure for complex networks. Here we developed a way to measure de $R_{comm}$ taking into account the results of overlapping communities detection algorithms.

The scripts contained here give a correction for the terms $E_{xx}$ and $E_{xy}$ used in the formula $R_{comm} = \frac{E_{xx} - E_{xy]^2}{1 - E_{xy]^2}$.
